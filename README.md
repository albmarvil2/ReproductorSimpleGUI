ReproductorSimpleGUI
====================

Another application for my end of degree project. It's a basic music player built with JavaSound library.

I'll scope to improve the GUI, and maybe give support for another music formats. The music formats already supported are:

  -WAVE
  -MP3

I'm using JavaSound libraries to playback the audio, those libraries provides support to playback WAVE audio.
I'm also using external libraries to playback MP3 files. You can find those external libraries in /lib directory.
